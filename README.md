# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To create UML diagrams for a Library Management System.

# SRS (Procedure):
Open StarUML and create a new project named Library Management System.

Design the following UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Package, Communication, and Sequence Diagrams.

Each diagram should represent system components, user interactions, and process flows clearly.

Save and export all diagrams, then include them in the report for documentation.
